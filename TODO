[ ] Add validation.. Done for Player and Game. Should probably print errors
[ ] Getting a list of Games should include the Player objects in one SQL statement
[ ] Common object properties should be moved out (eg. creatd_at)
[ ] Use something like watir to check /games/another

[X] Try and get tests to use an in memory sqlite3 db
[X] Ability to delete games
[X] Should really have some tests
[X] Should use timezones - Using utc by default, seems to solve the problem
[X] Player routes should match games routes
[X] Make it so that Players can be referenced directly from a Game

Also Ryan needs to find a way of showing if you win in 2 or 3 games, and counting 2 out of 3 as an aggregate win – that’s what really counts.

I’d also like to see a historical position table like this:

And probably a profile page like this:

General Stats:

Total Wins
Total Losses
Win/Loss Ratio
Longest Winning Streak
Longest Losing Streak
Number of goals scored when in attack
Number of goals conceded when in defence
Most popular team mate (who you have played with most often)
Most popular opponent (who you have played against often)

Player vs Player stats:

Number of wins against other player
Number of losses against other player
Number of goals scored when in attack against other player
Number of goals conceded when in defence against other player

I’m thinking the bottom four should be displayed as a bar, like the bottom of this picture:
